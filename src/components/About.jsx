    <h3>🧐 About HackBuddy</h3>
    <p>    
     What is HackBuddy? <br/>
     HackBuddy is your ultimate hackathon companion, built to help you survive and thrive through the chaos of coding sprints! Whether you need to track upcoming hackathons, laugh off your blockers with our Excuse Generator, check off essential submission items, or plan your next coding adventure, HackBuddy has your back.

     It’s not just an app—it’s your virtual buddy in the exhilarating (and sometimes chaotic) world of hackathons. Because hey, who said hacking can’t be fun and functional? 😎

    <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
    HackBuddy started as a spark of genius (read: a late-night idea fueled by tea and ambition) during my gap year. I wanted to build something quirky yet practical to prep for hackathons and make the experience a little less stressful and a lot more enjoyable. <br/>
    ✨ Mission: Keep it light, keep it fun, and keep hackers sane. <br/>
      When brainstorming features, I thought:
      <ol>
        <li>What’s something we all need during hackathons? Organization.</li>
        <li>What’s something we also need? A break from all that seriousness.</li>
      </ol>
        And voilà—HackBuddy was born! 🎉
    </p>

    <h3>HackBuddy Highlights</h3>
    <p>
    HackBuddy isn’t just an app—it’s a little slice of my personality:
    <ol>
      <li>Hackathon Tracker: Because who can remember all those dates? 🗓️</li>
      <li>Excuse Generator: Feeling stuck? Get hilarious excuses to lighten the mood. (You’re welcome.) 😜</li>
      <li>Submission Checklist: Let’s make sure you don’t forget the important stuff.</li>
      <li>What’s Next: Plan ahead so you can keep the momentum going. 🚀</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Hack for Hackers Hackathon</h3>
    <p>
    HackBuddy was created as my entry for the Hack for Hackers Hackathon, a fantastic event aimed at celebrating developers and their passion for coding. I wanted to use this opportunity to challenge myself, refine my React skills, and explore Flask and SQLite in a real-world project. <br/>
    The best part? It’s not just about coding—it’s about community, creativity, and challenging yourself. Win or lose, HackBuddy is already a victory in my book. 💪 Plus, it’s a solid excuse to procrastinate other things. 😉
